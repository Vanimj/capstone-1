<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* My very first step was trying to understand the problem
   
* I broke the entire project in to small chunks for better understaning.
* My Application is going to have two pages, one for Products, one for Shopping cart. 
* My data will be my json file( Product id, name, price, quantity)
* My home page will be displaying all the products, their price and quantity.
* There will be a Add to cart button, to add the product to shopping cart
* There will be a Search button to display searched products list.
* In Shopping cart page, its gonna show the count of the items added to the cart and their total price.
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* Under planning, i visualize the look and feel of the application.
* Where the nav bar should go.
* Where and how the products should align up on the page.
* Where the search bar should be placed.
* what should be displayed in shopping cart page.
* what data should i take in to consideration.
* How many components do i need for my application

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
* While executing, the very first and foremost thing is how many components do i need for my application
* How to route these components 
* Used React Router for routing and linking up the pages
* 
* If clicked on add to cart button, it should add to the cart and count should increase in the cart.
* if search button is clicked, searched products will be displayed.
*
*
<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
* I tried Context API and switched to hooks, back and forth for my add to cart functionality to work.
